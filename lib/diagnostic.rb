# Question 1
#
# In a Ruby comment, explain Behavior Driven Development, how it is meant to be
# used, and how it differs from Test Driven Development.

# BBD is a way to document and test your code as you are writting an application. BBD breaks your app into feature chunks. You write a test for each feature, run the test(to make sure it can fail), write unit tests, run the unit test( to make sure it can fail), write code to pass the unit test. You continue writing tests, code and running the tests until you've successfully created the feature. You continue to build your application following those steps.

# TDD is similar to BDD, but you write your unit tests first, then write the code to pass those tests and then write your feature test.

#
# Question 2
#
# Create a request spec for our Examples API that ensures 'GET /examples'
# responds successfully and lists all examples.

RSpec.describe 'Examples API' do
  describe 'GET /examples' do
    it 'lists all examples' do
      get '/examples'
      expect(response).to be_success
      examples_response = JSON.parse(response.body)
      expect(examples_response.length).to eq(example.count)
      expect(examples_response.first['text']).to eq(example['text'])
    end
  end
end

#
# Question 3
#
# Create a routing spec for our `Examples` resource that ensures
# GET /examples/:id routes to the examples#show action.

RSpec.describe 'routes for examples' do
  it 'routes GET /examples/:id to the examples#show action' do
      expect(get('examples/1')).to route_to(
        {
          controller: 'examples',
          action: 'show',
          id: '1'
        }
      )
  end
end

#
# Question 4
#
# Test that a POST action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders a JSON response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example_params
    {
      name: 'Example name',
      body: 'What a fantastic example this is...'
    }
  end

  describe 'POST create' do
  end

    it 'is successful' do
      expect(response.status).to eq(204)
    end

    it 'renders a JSON response' do
      examples_response = JSON.parse(response.body)
      expect(example_response).not_to be_nil
    end
  end
end

#
# Question 5
#
# Test that a PATCH action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders a JSON response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example_diff
    {
      body: 'This actually isn\'t that fantastic of an example...'
    }
  end

  describe 'PATCH update' do
    # your test(s) here
  end
end

#
# Question 6
#
# Test that a DELETE action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders an empty response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example
    Example.first
  end

  describe 'DELETE destroy' do
    # your test(s) here
  end
end

#
# Question 7
#
# Test that the Example model has an association with an
# `other` model. You'll have to build an `association` model
# on your own.

RSpec.describe Example do
  describe 'associations' do
    # association method here

    # test association with `other` here
  end
end
