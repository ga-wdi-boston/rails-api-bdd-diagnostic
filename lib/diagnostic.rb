#
# Question 1
#
# In a Ruby comment, explain Behavior Driven Development, how it is meant to be
# used, and how it differs from Test Driven Development.

# Behavior Driven Development is the approach of planning out/executing the
# development of an application by its features-- getting one piece of
# functionality completed at a time.
#
# Test Driven Development is the development approach of coding test conditions
# prior to coding a feature. Creating tests before hand drives the developer
# to demonstrate their understanding of the requirements/expected results
# and serves as a checklist for the developer to know when they are done.
#


#
# Question 2
#
# Create a request spec for our Examples API that ensures 'GET /examples'
# responds successfully and lists all examples.

RSpec.describe 'Examples API' do
  describe 'GET /examples' do
    it 'is successful' do
      get '/examples', nil, headers

      expect(response).to be_success

      parsed_response = JSON.parse(response.body)
      expect(
        parsed_response['examples']
      ).not_to be_empty
    end
  end
end

#
# Question 3
#
# Create a routing spec for our `Examples` resource that ensures
# GET /examples/:id routes to the examples#show action.

RSpec.describe 'routes for examples' do
  it 'routes GET /examples to the examples#index action' do
    expect(get('/examples')).to route_to('examples#index')
  end
end

#
# Question 4
#
# Test that a POST action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders a JSON response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example_params
    {
      name: 'Example name',
      body: 'What a fantastic example this is...'
    }
  end

  describe 'POST create' do
    before(:each) do
      post :create, { examples: example_params }, format: :json
    end

    it 'is successful' do
      expect(response).to be_successful
    end

    it 'renders a JSON response' do
      parsed_response = JSON.parse(response.body)
      expect(parsed_response).not_to be_nil
    end
  end

end

#
# Question 5
#
# Test that a PATCH action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders a JSON response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example_diff
    {
      body: 'This actually isn\'t that fantastic of an example...'
    }
  end

  describe 'PATCH update' do
      before(:each) do
        patch :update,
              { id: @example_id, body: example_params },
              format: :json
      end

      it 'is successful' do
        expect(response).to be_successful
      end

      it 'renders no response body' do
        expect(response.body).to be_empty
      end
  end
end

#
# Question 6
#
# Test that a DELETE action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders an empty response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example
    Example.first
  end

  describe 'DELETE destroy' do
    before(:each) do
        delete :destroy, id: @example_id, format: :json
      end

      it 'is successful' do
        expect(response).to be_successful
      end

      it 'renders no response body' do
        expect(response.body).to be_empty
      end
    end
end

#
# Question 7
#
# Test that the Example model has an association with an
# `other` model. You'll have to build an `association` model
# on your own.

RSpec.describe Example do
  describe 'associations' do
    # association method here

    # test association with `other` here
  end
end
