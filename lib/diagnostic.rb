# Question 1
#
# In a Ruby comment, explain Behavior Driven Development, how it is meant to be
# used, and how it differs from Test Driven Development.

# BDD outputs phrases that verify that you are building the right feature.
# It outputs statements IN ENGLISH so that people on the team other than
# engineers are clear what's going on. TDB does not output such phrases, and is
# only useful to engineers and others who understand the programming language.

# Question 2
#
# Create a request spec for our Examples API that ensures 'GET /examples'
# responds successfully and lists all examples.

RSpec.describe 'Examples API' do
  describe 'GET /examples' do
    it 'lists all examples' do
      get '/examples'

      expect(examples_response.length).to eq(examples.count)
      expect(examples_response.first['title']).to eq(example['title'])
    end
  end
end
# Followed example from yesterday's lesson

#
# Question 3
#
# Create a routing spec for our `Examples` resource that ensures
# GET /examples/:id routes to the examples#show action.

RSpec.describe 'routes for examples' do
  it 'routes GET /examples to the examples#index action' do
  expect(get('/examples')).to route_to('examples#index')
end
# Followed example from yesterday's lesson

#
# Question 4
#
# Test that a POST action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders a JSON response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example_params
    {
      name: 'Example name',
      body: 'What a fantastic example this is...'
    }
  end

  describe 'POST create' do
    before(:each) do
      post :create, example: example_params, format: :json
    end
  end

  # Used yesterday's lesson as a guide

#
# Question 5
#
# Test that a PATCH action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders a JSON response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example_diff
    {
      body: 'This actually isn\'t that fantastic of an example...'

    def example_diff
      {
        body: 'This is a better example...'
      }

# Used yesterday's example as a guide
#
# Question 6
#
# Test that a DELETE action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders an empty response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example
    Example.first
  end

  describe 'DELETE destroy' do
    it 'is successful and returns an empty response' do
      delete :destroy, id: example.id
  end
end

# Referenced yesterday's lesson

#
# Question 7
#
# Test that the Example model has an association with an
# `other` model. You'll have to build an `association` model
# on your own.

RSpec.describe Example do
  describe 'associations' do
    def example_associations
