#
# Question 1
#
# In a Ruby comment, explain Behavior Driven Development, how it is meant to be
# used, and how it differs from Test Driven Development.

# Behavior Driven Development is designing an application with user
# functionality motivating the behavior of the application.  It is meant to be
# used by relying on resources such as user stories to inspire code rather than
# starting to write an app without a specific goal in mind.  It differs from
# Test Driven Development in that the latter is driven by writing code meant to
# pass specific tests which is only later refactored.

#
# Question 2
#
# Create a request spec for our Examples API that ensures 'GET /examples'
# responds successfully and lists all examples.

RSpec.describe 'Examples API' do
  it 'lists all examples' do
    get '/examples'
    expect(response).to be_success
  end
end

#
# Question 3
#
# Create a routing spec for our `Examples` resource that ensures
# GET /examples/:id routes to the examples#show action.

RSpec.describe 'routes for examples' do
  it 'routes GET /examples/:id to the examples#show action' do
    expect(get('/examples/1')).to route_to(
      controllers: 'examples',
      action: 'show',
      id: '1'
    )
  end
end

#
# Question 4
#
# Test that a POST action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders a JSON response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example_params
    {
      name: 'Example name',
      body: 'What a fantastic example this is...'
    }
  end

  describe 'POST create' do
    before(:each) do
      post :create, example: example_params, format: :json
    end

    it 'is successful' do
      expect(response.status).to eq(201)
    end

    it 'renders a JSON response' do
      expect(JSON.parse(response.body)).not_to be_nil
    end
  end
end

#
# Question 5
#
# Test that a PATCH action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders a JSON response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example_diff
    {
      body: 'This actually isn\'t that fantastic of an example...'
    }
  end

  describe 'PATCH update' do
    def example_diff
      { name: 'Example name' }
    end

    before(:each) do
      patch :update, id: example.id, example: example_diff, format: :json
    end

    it 'is successful' do
      expect(response).to be_success
    end

    it 'renders a JSON response' do
      expect(JSON.parse(response.body)).not_to be_nil
    end
  end
end

#
# Question 6
#
# Test that a DELETE action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders an empty response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example
    Example.first
  end

  describe 'DELETE destroy' do
    it 'is successful and returns an empty response' do
      delete :destroy, id: example.id
      expect(response).to be_success
      expect(response.body).to be_empty
    end
  end
end
