# Question 1
#
# In a Ruby comment, explain Behavior Driven Development, how it is meant to be
# used, and how it differs from Test Driven Development.

Behavior Driven Development is meant to be used before you start coding to determine
all types of bugs. Test Driven Development limits the amount of bugs you can catch.
Behavior Driven Development allows you to check for feature tests and unit tests.
(For both the user and the developer).

#
# Question 2
#
# Create a request spec for our Examples API that ensures 'GET /examples'
# responds successfully and lists all examples.

RSpec.describe 'Examples API' do
  get "/examples/#{example.id}"

      expect(response).to be_success

      example_response = JSON.parse(response.body)
      expect(example_response['id']).to eq(example['id'])
      expect(example_response['API']).to eq(example['API'])
end

#
# Question 3
#
# Create a routing spec for our `Examples` resource that ensures
# GET /examples/:id routes to the examples#show action.

RSpec.describe 'routes for examples' do
  it 'routes GET /examples/:id to the examples#show action' do
      expect(get('/examples/1')).to route_to(
        controller: 'examples',
        action: 'show',
        id: '1'
      )

end

#
# Question 4
#
# Test that a POST action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders a JSON response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example_params
    {
      name: 'Example name',
      body: 'What a fantastic example this is...'
    }
  end

  describe 'POST create' do
    before(:each) do
        post :name, body: example_params, format: :json
  end
end

#
# Question 5
#
# Test that a PATCH action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders a JSON response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example_diff
    {
      body: 'This actually isn\'t that fantastic of an example...'
    }
  end

  describe 'PATCH update' do
    # your test(s) here
  end
end

#
# Question 6
#
# Test that a DELETE action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders an empty response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example
    Example.first
  end

  describe 'DELETE destroy' do
    # your test(s) here
  end
end

#
# Question 7
#
# Test that the Example model has an association with an
# `other` model. You'll have to build an `association` model
# on your own.

RSpec.describe Example do
  describe 'associations' do
    # association method here

    # test association with `other` here
  end
end
