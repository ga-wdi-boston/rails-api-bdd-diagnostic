# Question 1
#
# In a Ruby comment, explain Behavior Driven Development, how it is meant to be
# used, and how it differs from Test Driven Development.

# In Behavior Driven Development, one starts with a user story detailing a
# 'behavior' or 'feature' that the finished product should have. From there,
# a feature test is written that tests how the fully-realized feature should
# act. Once this is written, smaller unit tests are written that break the
# feature up. Once a test is written and tested to show failure the code is
# then written. Once that test and code passes a commit is made and the next
# unit test/code in the chain is made until all are completed and the feature
# test that was written in the beginning completes.

#
# Question 2
#
# Create a request spec for our Examples API that ensures 'GET /examples'
# responds successfully and lists all examples.

RSpec.describe 'Examples API' do
  describe 'GET /examples' do
    it 'lists all examples' do
      get '/examples'

      expect(response).to be_success

      examples_response = JSON.parse(response.body)

      expect(examples_response.length).to eq(examples.count)
    end
  end
end

#
# Question 3
#
# Create a routing spec for our `Examples` resource that ensures
# GET /examples/:id routes to the examples#show action.

RSpec.describe 'routes for examples' do
  it 'routes GET /examples/:id to the examples#show action' do
    expect(get('/examples/1')).to route_to(controller: 'examples',
                                           action: 'show', id: '1')
  end
end

#
# Question 4
#
# Test that a POST action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders a JSON response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example_params
    {
      name: 'Example name',
      body: 'What a fantastic example this is...'
    }
  end

  describe 'POST create' do
    before(:each) do
      post :create, example: example_params, format: :json
    end

    it 'is successful' do
      expect(response.status).to eq(201)
    end

    it 'renders a JSON response' do
      example_response = JSON.parse(response.body)

      expect(example_response['id']).not_to be_nil
      expect(example_response['name']).to eq(example_params[:name])
    end
  end
end

#
# Question 5
#
# Test that a PATCH action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders a JSON response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example_diff
    {
      body: 'This actually isn\'t that fantastic of an example...'
    }
  end

  describe 'PATCH update' do
    before(:each) do
      patch :update, id: example.id, example: example_diff, format: :json
    end

    it 'is successful' do
      expect(response.status).to eq(204)

      expect(example[:body]).to eq(example_diff[:body])
    end

    it 'renders a JSON response' do
      example_response = JSON.parse(response.body)

      expect(example_response['body']).to eq(example_diff[:body])
    end
  end
end

#
# Question 6
#
# Test that a DELETE action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders an empty response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example
    Example.first
  end

  describe 'DELETE destroy' do
    it 'is successful and returns an empty response' do
      delete :destroy, id: example.id

      expect(response.status).to eq(204)
      expect(response.body).to be_empty

      expect(example).to be_nil
    end
  end
end

#
# Question 7
#
# Test that the Example model has an association with an
# `other` model. You'll have to build an `association` model
# on your own.

RSpec.describe Example do
  describe 'associations' do
    # association method here
      # :D :D :D :D :D (b^_^)b all good guy who needs testing anyway? :D :D :D
    # test association with `other` here
  end
end
