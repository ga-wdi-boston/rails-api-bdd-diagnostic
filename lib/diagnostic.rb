# Question 1
#
# In a Ruby comment, explain Behavior Driven Development, how it is meant to be
# used, and how it differs from Test Driven Development.

```rb
BDD is focused on top-down testing whereas TDD focuses on testing first. In
BDD we write specs that then drive how we develop. The specs are generally
developed from user stories. In TDD the tests drive development and a cycle
includes writing a unit test, running the test (expect it to fail), refactoring
the code until the test passes, and then repeating the process.

#
# Question 2
#
# Create a request spec for our Examples API that ensures 'GET /examples'
# responds successfully and lists all examples.

RSpec.describe 'Examples API' do
  describe 'GET /examples' do
    it 'lists all examples' do
      get '/examples'

      expect(response).to be_success

      examples_response = JSON.parse(response.body)
      expect(examples_response.length).to eq(examples.count)
      expect(examples_response.first['title']).to eq(example['title'])
    end
  end
end

#
# Question 3
#
# Create a routing spec for our `Examples` resource that ensures
# GET /examples/:id routes to the examples#show action.

RSpec.describe 'routes for examples' do
  it 'routes GET /examples/:id to the examples#show action' do
    expect(get('/examples/1')).to route_to(
      controller: 'examples',
      action: 'show',
      id: '1'
    )
  end
end

#
# Question 4
#
# Test that a POST action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders a JSON response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example_params
    {
      name: 'Example name',
      body: 'What a fantastic example this is...'
    }
  end

  describe 'POST create' do
    before(:each) do
      post :create, params: { example: example_params }
    end

    it 'is successful' do
      expect(response).to be_success
    end

    it 'renders a JSON response' do
      example = JSON.parse(response.body)
      expect(example).not_to be_nil
    end
  end
end

#
# Question 5
#
# Test that a PATCH action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders a JSON response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example_diff
    {
      body: 'This actually isn\'t that fantastic of an example...'
    }
  end

  describe 'PATCH update' do
    before(:each) do
      patch :update, params: { id: example.id, example: example_diff }
    end

    it 'is successful' do
      expect(response).to be_success
    end

    it 'returns an empty response' do
      expect(response.body).to be_empty
    end
  end
end

#
# Question 6
#
# Test that a DELETE action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders an empty response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example
    Example.first
  end

  describe 'DELETE destroy' do
    it 'is successful and returns an empty response' do
      delete :destroy, params: { id: example.id }

      expect(response).to be_success
      expect(response.body).to be_empty
    end
  end
end

#
# Question 7
#
# Test that the Example model has an association with an
# `other` model. You'll have to build an `association` model
# on your own.

RSpec.describe Example do
  describe 'associations' do
    # association method here

    # test association with `other` here
  end
end
