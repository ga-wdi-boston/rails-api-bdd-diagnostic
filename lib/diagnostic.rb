#
# Question 1
#
# In a Ruby comment, explain Behavior Driven Development, how it is meant to be
# used, and how it differs from Test Driven Development.

# Behavior Driven Development is similar to Test Driven Development in that a developer
#creates tests for each unit before writing the code, and only moves on once the code
#passes the test. It is used to make sure every piece works as intended before moving on.
#BDD is different than TDD because it puts more emphasis on the intended behavior of a unit.
#Before a test can be written, first, user story statements must be created, and the
#test that is written has to be written to satisfy those behavior requirements.

#
# Question 2
#
# Create a request spec for our Examples API that ensures 'GET /examples'
# responds successfully and lists all examples.

RSpec.describe 'Examples API' do
  it 'lists all examples' do
      get '/examples'

      expect(response).to be_success

      examples_response = JSON.parse(response.body)
      expect(examples_response.length).to eq(examples.count)
      expect(examples_response.first['text']).to eq(example['text'])
    end
end

#
# Question 3
#
# Create a routing spec for our `Examples` resource that ensures
# GET /examples/:id routes to the examples#show action.

RSpec.describe 'routes for examples' do
  it 'routes GET /examples/:id to the examples#show action' do
  expect(get '/examples/1').to route_to(
    controller: 'examples',
    action: 'show',
    id: '1'
  )
  end
end

#
# Question 4
#
# Test that a POST action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders a JSON response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example_params
    {
      name: 'Example name',
      body: 'What a fantastic example this is...'
    }
  end

  describe 'POST create' do
    before(:each) do
      post :create, article: example_params, format: :json
    end

    it 'is successful' do
      expect(response.status).to eq(201)
    end

    it 'renders a JSON response' do
      example_response = JSON.parse(response.body)
      expect(example_response).not_to be_nil
      expect(example_response['text']).to eq(example_params[:body])
    end
  end
end

#
# Question 5
#
# Test that a PATCH action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders a JSON response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example_diff
    {
      body: 'This actually isn\'t that fantastic of an example...'
    }
  end

  describe 'PATCH update' do
    before(:each) do
      patch :update, id: example.id, article: example_diff, format: :json
    end

    it 'is successful' do
      expect(response).to be_successful
    end

    it 'renders a JSON response' do
      example_response = JSON.parse(response.body)
      expect(example_response).not_to be_nil
    end
  end
end

#
# Question 6
#
# Test that a DELETE action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders an empty response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example
    Example.first
  end

at  describe 'DELETE destroy' do
  it 'is successful and returns an empty response' do
    delete :destroy, id: article.id, format: :json

    expect(response).to be_successful
    expect(response.body).to be_empty
    end
  end
