#
# Question 1
#
# In a Ruby comment, explain Behavior Driven Development, how it is meant to be
# used, and how it differs from Test Driven Development.

# Behavior Driven Development is a technique that involves writing your
# tests as you code. The basic flow is: Write a feature test, watch it fail,
# write a unit test, watch it fail, and write code to satisfy the unit test.
# BDD starts from the top (the behavior, function) while TDD starts at the
# bottom with unit tests and builds up. Both are development testing
# methodologies.

#
# Question 2
#
# Create a request spec for our Examples API that ensures 'GET /examples'
# responds successfully and lists all examples.

RSpec.describe 'Examples API' do
  it 'lists all examples' do
    get '/examples'

    expect(response).to be_success

    example_response = JSON.parse(response.body)

    expect(example_response.length).to eq(examples.count)
    expect(example_response.first['text']).to eq(example['text'])
  end
end

#
# Question 3
#
# Create a routing spec for our `Examples` resource that ensures
# GET /examples/:id routes to the examples#show action.

RSpec.describe 'routes for examples' do
  it 'routes GET /examples/:id to the examples#show action' do
    expect(get('/examples/1')).to route_to(
      controller: 'examples',
      action: 'show',
      id: '1'
    )
  end
end

#
# Question 4
#
# Test that a POST action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders a JSON response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example_params
    {
      name: 'Example name',
      body: 'What a fantastic example this is...'
    }
  end

  describe 'POST create' do
    before(:each) do
      post :create, example: example_params, format: :json
    end

    it 'is successful' do
      expect(response).to be_successful
    end

    it 'renders a JSON response' do
      example_response = JSON.parse(response.body)
      expect(example_response).not_to be_nil
    end
  end
end

#
# Question 5
#
# Test that a PATCH action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders a JSON response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example_diff
    {
      body: 'This actually isn\'t that fantastic of an example...'
    }
  end

  describe 'PATCH update' do
    before(:each) do
      patch :update, body: example.body, example: example_diff, format: :json
    end

    it 'is successful' do
      expect(response).to be_successful
    end

    it 'renders a JSON response' do
      example_response = JSON.parse(response.body)
      expect(example_response).not_to be_nil
    end
  end
end

#
# Question 6
#
# Test that a DELETE action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders an empty response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example
    Example.first
  end

  describe 'DELETE destroy' do
    it 'is successful and returns an empty response' do
      delete :destroy, id: example.id

      expect(response).to be_successful
      expect(response.body).to be_empty
    end
  end
end

#
# Question 7
#
# Test that the Example model has an association with an
# `other` model. You'll have to build an `association` model
# on your own.

RSpec.describe Example do
  describe 'associations' do
    def association
      described_class.reflect_on_association(:other)
    end
    it 'has an association with other' do
      expect(association).to_not be_nil
      expect(association.name).to eq(:other)
    end
  end
end
