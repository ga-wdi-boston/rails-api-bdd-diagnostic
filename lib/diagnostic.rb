# Question 1
#
# In a Ruby comment, explain Behavior Driven Development, how it is meant to be
# used, and how it differs from Test Driven Development.


# TDD is the concept of writing tests of how you expect a system to behave. It is a process in which developers write a bunch of small tests and run the tests and revise their code until they pass each small test. BDD is follows the same idea, but the tests are written in a more verbose way/syntactical to be very clear in their intent.

#
# Question 2
#
# Create a request spec for our Examples API that ensures 'GET /examples'
# responds successfully and lists all examples.

RSpec.describe 'Examples API' do

  describe 'GET /examples' do
    it 'lists all example' do
      get '/examples'

      expect(response).to be_success

      examples_response = JSON.parse(response.body)
      expect(examples_response.length).to eq(examples.count)
    end
  end
end
#
# Question 3
#
# Create a routing spec for our `Examples` resource that ensures
# GET /examples/:id routes to the examples#show action.

RSpec.describe 'routes for examples' do
  it 'routes GET /examples/:id to the examples#show action' do
    expect(get('/examples/1')).to route_to(
      controller: 'examples',
      action: 'show',
      id: 1
    )
  end
end

#
# Question 4
#
# Test that a POST action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders a JSON response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example_params
    {
      name: 'Example name',
      body: 'What a fantastic example this is...'
    }
  end

  describe 'POST create' do
    before(:each) do
      post :create, example: example_params, format: :json
    end

    it 'is successful' do
      expect(response).to be_success
    end

    it 'renders a JSON response' do
      expect(JSON.parse(response.body)).not_to be_nil
    end
  end
end

#
# Question 5
#
# Test that a PATCH action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders a JSON response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example_diff
    {
      body: 'This actually isn\'t that fantastic of an example...'
    }
  end

  describe 'PATCH update' do
    before(:each) do
      patch :update, id: example.id, example: example_diff, format: :json
    end

    it 'is successful' do
      expect(response).to be_success
    end

    it 'renders a JSON response' do
      expect(JSON.parse(response.body)).not_to be_nil
    end
  end
end


#
# Question 6
#
# Test that a DELETE action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders an empty response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example
    Example.first
  end

  describe 'DELETE destroy' do
    it 'is successful and returns an empty response' do
      delete :destroy, example: example
      expect(response.status).to eq(204)
      expect(response.body).to be_empty
    end
  end
