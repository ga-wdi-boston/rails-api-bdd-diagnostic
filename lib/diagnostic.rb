# Question 1
#
# In a Ruby comment, explain Behavior Driven Development, how it is meant to be
# used, and how it differs from Test Driven Development.

# behavior driven development means starting from user stories and what an app is intended to do, working on the largest level first, then going to small units in order to write code. Test Driven Deveopment is the opposite, starting from a very small piece of the puzzle and getting that to work, then getting the pieces to work together

# Question 2
#
# Create a request spec for our Examples API that ensures 'GET /examples'
# responds successfully and lists all examples.

RSpec.describe 'Examples API' do
  it 'lists all examples' do
      # get is a functions -- takes a string, makes a get request to that
      # address

      # articles we created

      # in
      expect(examples_response.first['title']).to eq(example['title'])
    end

#
# Question 3
#
# Create a routing spec for our `Examples` resource that ensures
# GET /examples/:id routes to the examples#show action.

RSpec.describe 'routes for examples' do

#
# Question 4
#
# Test that a POST action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders a JSON response.

# Question 5

# Test that a PATCH action from our ExamplesController is both successful

# Question 6

# Test that a DELETE action from our ExamplesController is both successful

#
# Question 7
#
# Test that the Example model has an association with an
# `other` model. You'll have to build an `association` model
# on your own.

RSpec.describe Example do
  describe 'associations' do
    # association method here
